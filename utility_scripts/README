merge_star_counts.py
    Merge counts from multiple STAR outputs into a matrix

calculate_TMM.R
    TMM normalize output matrix from merge_star_counts.py

generate_genoypeGvcf_jobs.py (GATK4)
    Generate slurm job scripts to call genotypes on the merged gVCFs from generate_merge_vcf_jobs.py

generate_merge_vcf_jobs.py (Necesarry for GATK3)
    Generate slurm job scripts to merge haplotype output (gVCFs) together in batches of 200

generate_genoypeGvcf_GATK3_jobs.py
    For testing reasons call genotypes on the merged gVCFs from generate_merge_vcf_jobs.py
    This generates the slurm jobs
