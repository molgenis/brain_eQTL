Everything necesarry to make the Molgenis Compute pipeline to align and quantify all samples from our brain eQTL project.

Before starting, download the FastQ files with scripts from /scratch/umcg-ndeklein/brain_eQTL/synapase_download_scripts/ or by requesting them.


make_alignmentAndQuantification_pipeline.sh:
    usage: make_alignmentAndQuantification_pipeline.sh -c cohort -p project_directory
      -c      provide the cohort to prepare pipeline for (mandatory)
      -p      Base of the project_dir where pipeline scripts will be put (mandatory)
      -h      display help
    NOTE: This script contains hard-coded paths to where the data is stored, so change before running
