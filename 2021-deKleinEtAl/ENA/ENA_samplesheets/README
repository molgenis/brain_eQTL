Download ENA samplesheets from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/warehouse/search:
    - Select domain: Read
    - Taxon name: Homo sapiens
    - Library strategy: RNA-Seq
Then on left side click on Run -> Reports -> select columns -> select all the columns
Then click TEXT. File is downloaded as ena.txt

To keep file size small for github, the samlesheet is filtered on only samples that will be processed with
    python filter_ENA_samplesheet.py

Output is written to samplesheet_ENA_<date>.txt. These are all the brain samples that are found in ../brain_samples/.

Since the data in ../brain_samples/ is run separatly, there can be some samples included that since then have been removed from ENA
These are written to
    missing_samples_<date>.txt
