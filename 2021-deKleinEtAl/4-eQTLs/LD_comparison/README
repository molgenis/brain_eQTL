Replicating MetaBrain in eQTLgen gives lower than expected replication rates (~88%). 
Calculate the LD and D' between the concordant and disconcordant top SNPs.

Do it in 3 steps:
1. get_top_snps.py
    Get the genes that are eQTLs in metaBrain and save the top SNP, then find the same gene in eQTLgen and also select the top SNP (if significant)

2. calculate_ld.py
    Calculate the LD for the metabrain top snp and eqtlgen top snp

3. visualize_ld.R
    Visualize the results
